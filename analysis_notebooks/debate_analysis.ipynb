    "## Part 2: Vice Presidential and Presidential Debate Analysis\n",
    "* Debates are a tool for the candidates to appeal to an audience deciding who to vote for in the election. \n",
    "    * Viewers of these debates might already have a candidate in mind, but the audience isn't directed towards only one side, like the conventions. \n",
    "* This analysis will include a classifier, which will try to predict if a spoken line is republican or democratic.\n",
    "    * Goal: find key words used by each candidate to further their arguments. Also, find accuracy of the classifier for my hypothesis. \n",
    "* I will also be making a model based off of token length to see if speaking a lot is a persuasion choice made by the candidates. "
