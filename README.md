#### Project Title: Analyzing Political Rhetoric
Welcome to my project about politics and persuasion. In this github repository, there is analysis on words used by politicians in different settings to find if there is a difference between Republican and Democratic use of "hot topic" words. These hot topic words are used to support their own stances by hitting audiences with words that have heavy emphasis. Additionally, the analysis presented also differentiates between different "modes" of persuasive text, and how that might influence the use of rhetoric.

The data found in this notebook can be found in six places:
* [Kaggle DNC](https://www.kaggle.com/christianlillelund/2020-democratic-convention-speeches)
* [Kaggle RNC](https://www.kaggle.com/christianlillelund/2020-republican-convention-speeches)
* [REV VP](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-mike-pence-2020-vice-presidential-debate-transcript)
* [REV PRES](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020)
